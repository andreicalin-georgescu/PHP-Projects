# Mini Framework

The following is a basic implementation of a framework using PHP. It is being developed as part of
an interactive course on codecourse.com.

It serves as an understanding of the implementation of several basic framework concepts such as 
containers and routing, controllers and responses.

This application also allows working with models.

## Disclaimer
This application has been developed only for learning purposes and should under any 
circumstances be used for real-world working scenarios

### Todo
- update the run method to react to not having an error handler stored in the container;
- extend on the User Model;
- improve the error reporting classes.

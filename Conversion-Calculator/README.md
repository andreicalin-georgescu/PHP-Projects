# Currency Calculator

The following is a very basic currency calculator using the 
https://exchangeratesapi.io API, alongside with Guzzle.

Guzzle was installed with Composer dependency manager and the files needed are
included in this repo.

To test locally, an APACHE Server is required.

To add more currencies, refer to https://exchangeratesapi.io to check for
available currencies and modify the config.php file.

This project is a slight improvement over the one presented during the 
PHP Essentials course on https://codecourse.com.

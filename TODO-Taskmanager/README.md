The following is a simple **Task Manager** built as part of the Practical OOP
course on *codecourse.com.*

It offers basic functionalities such as adding, editing, deleting and listing tasks.

**TODO:**
- A frontend to the details page of a task should be added;
the application.
- After deleting a task, the users should still see all their remaining ones on homepage.

**Caveats**
- The application is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting, as adding such 
a protection for this simple app seemed like overkill.
